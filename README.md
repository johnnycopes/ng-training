# NgTraining

This is my submission for the coding challenge portion of the Angular exam from [Angular Training](https://www.angulartraining.com/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
